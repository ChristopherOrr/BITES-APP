# COSC-4P02 Capstone Project

## Problem

The field of software engineering has developed greatly in recent decades, and as such there is a growing need for supporting tools to assist students and educators in training new software engineers. User-friendly applications improve the process of education are a constant demand. Our group has set out to develop a new web application tailored to the needs of aspiring software engineers.

## Project Description
In traditional educational settings, software engineering courses often face challenges in engaging students and providing an interactive and dynamic learning environment. Conventional methods may struggle to adapt to individual learning styles, making it difficult for students to grasp complex concepts effectively. Additionally, the availability of diverse learning resources and instant feedback on assessments is often limited, hindering the overall learning experience.

## Objectives
The objective of this project is to develop an Interactive Software Training Engineering System (BITES), a comprehensive platform that addresses the shortcomings of current educational methods. BITES aims to create an immersive and adaptive learning environment for software engineering and other related courses, enhancing student understanding and performance.
